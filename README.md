# Credit Card Fraud Detection
This repository contains R code for building and evaluating a credit card fraud detection system using the Credit Card Fraud dataset available on Kaggle. The project involves data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation to detect fraudulent transactions effectively.

## Purpose
The main objective of this code is to showcase the implementation of a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning algorithms. The project covers the creation of training and test datasets, the development of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest models, and the evaluation of these models using Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) metrics.

## R Markdown (RMD) Report
Furthermore, an R Markdown file (Project_Report_RMD_File.Rmd) has been included in this repository. This RMD file contains a detailed report documenting the project's methodology, including data exploration, model development, and evaluation. The report has been knitted into a PDF file (Project_Report.pdf), providing comprehensive insights into the fraud detection system's performance and analysis of results.

Feel free to refer to the RMD report for a deeper understanding of the project's implementation, challenges faced, and recommendations for further improvements.

*Note: This project's RMD file template was inspired by a template, and AI (ChatGPT) was used to assist in commenting on the code. While AI support was utilized, the project's development is the result of individual effort and understanding.*
